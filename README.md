# Psy524/L: Multivariate Statistics at California State University, Northridge
Repository for Psy524

In this repository you will find lecture slides, laboratory assignments and data sets needed for the course. 

I put the files in this repository in order to connect the material with the course's Canvas page and so that the material will remain accessible to you after the semester is over.
